# Phase 2-4 Implementation Progress

## Phase 2: Feel & Physics ✅

### Critical Fixes (Priority 1):
1. ✅ Ball size 14px → 20px (already applied)
2. 🔄 Quick match checks 6 games not 4
3. 🔄 Opponent serve faults (currently never faults)
4. 🔄 Bounce coefficient 0.65 → 0.72 (current: 0.72, but serve has 0.68)
5. 🔄 Better hit sounds (layered)
6. 🔄 Point celebration (flash + haptic)

### Physics Improvements:
7. 🔄 Ball arc divisor /12 → /10 (for more visible trajectories)
8. 🔄 Spin effects 0.01 → 0.025 (current: 0.008-0.012)
9. 🔄 Serve gravity 0.12 → 0.14 (current: 0.12)

## Phase 3: Juice & Polish 

### Hitstop & Feel:
10. ❌ Hitstop on powerful shots (brief pause for impact)
11. ❌ Rally tension system (crowd gets louder)
12. ❌ Enhanced results screen with match statistics

## Phase 4: Features

13. ❌ Daily challenges system
14. ❌ Ball and swipe trails
15. ❌ Achievement system
16. ❌ Tournament mode
